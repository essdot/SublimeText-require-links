# SublimeText-require-links

This is a Sublime Text plugin that allows you to ctrl+click on a `require` path in a Node module to open that file.

To install, clone this repo in your Packages directory. Change the `node_path` setting in `require-links.sublime-settings` if you need to.

**NOTE**: The code for this plugin is currently extremely shitty and using it is probably a bad idea.
